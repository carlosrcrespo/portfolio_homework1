			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/carlospic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Carlos Crespo Picture">

			<p>Growing up in the culturally vibrant city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, I was privileged to be surrounded by art, music, theater, literature and poetry from a very young age.  This background engendered in me a lifelong passion for experiencing and creating art.  Today I am a freelance graphic designer in Charlotte,NC.</p>

			<p>I have advanced skills in CS Suite, Logic, and different types of CMS and over 15 years of experience as a graphic designer in both Ecuador and North Carolina.</p>

			<p>Currently I work for Britax Child Safety as Senior Graphic Designer and as a freelance for local clients such as Centralina Council of Governments, Carolinas Care Partnership, the Latin American Women’s Association, among others. </p>
